Please update and finalize the MemeMakers Hub project with the following corrections and additions. This build is live-facing — no mockups, no placeholders.

🎯 1. ✅ AUTHENTICATION (FIX)

Enable Firebase Email and Password sign up and login alongside Google

Update /auth page to include:

Email + Password form fields

"Forgot Password" link

Switch between Login / Sign Up mode

Use Firebase Auth (already configured)

📜 2. ✅ TERMS, PRIVACY, CONTACT, HELP CENTER

Create separate routes/pages for:

/terms – Terms of Service

/privacy – Privacy Policy

/help – Help Center

/contact – Contact Us

Each should be responsive and contain:

terms-page.tsx, privacy-page.tsx, etc.

Use static content from uploaded spec or placeholder text that can be edited

Add working contact form on /contact:

Fields: Name, Email, Message

Submissions should go to mememakershub@gmail.com or Firestore

Ensure none of these pages return 404 errors anymore

🎨 5. ✅ UI & BRANDING FIXES

🔗 Socials: Keep ONLY:

Twitter: https://x.com/mememakershub

Telegram: https://t.me/+xmr1qGCVdAc5YThk

Remove Discord, Instagram, Facebook, etc.

🎨 Colors: No text or icon should be white (#ffffff) or ash (#e5e5e5, gray-100, etc.)

Replace with brand colors inspired by the logo:

Indigo: #6366F1

Accent Blue: #3B82F6

Light backgrounds: #F9FAFB

Text: #111827

🌓 Dark mode should remain supported but match these tones

📍 6. ✅ NAVIGATION & ROUTING

Fix all broken routes that return 404, especially:

/contact

/help

/terms

/privacy

Add links to footer or navbar for:

Terms of Service

Privacy Policy

Help Center

Contact Us

✅ Reminder:

Do not leave any mockups or placeholders unless explicitly stated

All buttons and routes must be functional

Firebase and wallet integration already exist — don’t break them

Let me know when this updated version is complete so I can test and deploy.
