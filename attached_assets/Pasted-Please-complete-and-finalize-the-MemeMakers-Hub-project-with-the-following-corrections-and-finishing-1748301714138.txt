Please complete and finalize the MemeMakers Hub project with the following corrections and finishing steps:

---

🎨 1. TEXT VISIBILITY FIX
- Search the entire project (especially `client/src`) for all:
  - `text-white`, `text-gray-100`, `text-gray-200`, `text-slate-100`, or similar light text classes
- Replace them with:
  - `text-black` or `text-neutral-900` or `text-brand-text` (if configured)

✅ Ensure all text is readable on white/light backgrounds on:
- Hero sections
- Cards
- Buttons
- Footer
- Navbar
- Dashboard
- Forms

---

📘 2. ADD & FIX `/docs` PAGE (Developer Documentation)

- Create a new route: `/docs`
- Page name: `docs-page.tsx` or similar
- Add it to the router in `App.tsx` or wherever routes are defined
- Populate it with the following exact content (use code blocks where shown):

  "email": "john@example.com",

  "createdAt": "timestamp"
}                                                                   💸 Payments

ETH address: 0xD96870Eb59987688BcE09b2D3423a3665133B5cc

SOL address: 9muDjFKPbyY6rvLnVAPrqCjtx5Eb4syy4WdRqb3yL8Bi

Wallet connect: MetaMask + Phantom

Payment buttons trigger onClick wallet send, with toast feedback

🧾 Referral Tracking

Referral code from ?ref=abc123 stored in localStorage

Attached to booking form if user completes it

Referral commissions tracked in /referrals collection in Firestore

🎖 NFT Badge (Future)

Placeholder NFTBadge.tsx component exists

Uses Thirdweb SDK

Prepared for Polygon, Base, or BNB Chain

Requires contract address to activate

📞 Contact & Support

Contact form submits to Firestore (or fallback to mailto:mememakershub@gmail.com)

Help Center is a static FAQ-style page

✅ Style the documentation using the same layout and branding as the rest of the site.

🧼 3. VERIFY STATIC ROUTES (FIX 404s)

Ensure the following pages are all working (not 404):

/terms

/privacy

/help

/contact

/docs

If any are missing:

Create and add the .tsx page in src/pages

Register the route in your router setup

🧪 4. FINAL DEBUG & CLEANUP BEFORE DEPLOYMENT

Run a full debug scan across the entire project

Ensure:

No broken imports

All routes are mapped correctly

All Firebase logic is live (not mocked)

Wallet connect works (MetaMask + Phantom)

Contact form, bookings, and referrals save to Firestore

All buttons are clickable

Mobile responsiveness is preserved

Console is clear of warnings and errors

✅ This is the final pass before live deployment. No placeholders or broken UI should remain.

Let me know when the final version is complete so I can proceed with launch and testing.
