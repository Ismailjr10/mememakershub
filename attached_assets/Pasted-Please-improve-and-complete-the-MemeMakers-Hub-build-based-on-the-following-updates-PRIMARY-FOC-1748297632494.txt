Please improve and complete the MemeMakers Hub build based on the following updates:

🎯 PRIMARY FOCUS

Fix the Membership and Marketplace pages to reflect real services and pricing

Apply colors and style that match our uploaded logo (crescent moon with star)

Do not use location-based pricing. All prices are in USD only.

Ensure all layout is responsive, modern, and clean

Also use the image attach as the logo

🎨 VISUAL + THEME

Base all colors on the uploaded logo.png

Primary colors should be inspired by the logo colors

Use Inter font family with shadcn/ui components

Respect Web3-friendly, clean layouts (rounded corners, hover cards, gradient buttons, etc.)
